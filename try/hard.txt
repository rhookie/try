If you want to be better ,you should cherish every seconds.
Do things with a clear ambition.
Everything without thinking carefully will loss any meanings.
It will loss any advantage if you don't think clearly.
Live at now ,be concentrated on!
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practically beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity,refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one--and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain,it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namesapces are one honking great idea --let's do more of those!
